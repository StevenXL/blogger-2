# Blogger 2 #

This repository will retain my project as I use [Jumpstart Lab's Blogger 2 Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).

The tutorial will go over:
* Models, Views, and Controlles (MVC)
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Adding gems for extra features
